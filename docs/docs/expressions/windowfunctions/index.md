# Window Functions

**Window functions** compute values over a group of rows that are somehow related to the current rowâ€”commonly referred to as a *window*. Unlike aggregate functions, window functions do not collapse rows, making them ideal for tasks like ranking, running totals, or accessing neighboring values.

Each window function defines how it processes rows within its partition, and may consider ordering, frame boundaries, and more.

Browse the available window functions below to learn more about their behavior and usage.
