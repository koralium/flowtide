The SQL Server Source can be added to the 'ReadWriteFactory' with the following line: factory.AddSqlServerSource(&quot;your regexp on table names&quot;, () =&gt; connectionString);  The connection string must be set as a function, since the idea is that the connection string might change, from say a system such asHashicorp Vault. The source uses the following logic to fetch data into the stream:  The source will retry fetching data in-case of a SQL Server error, as long as it can reconnect to the database.

This means that its table output can always be traced back to a state from the source systems. To use the SQL Server Sink add the following line to the ReadWriteFactory: factory.AddSqlServerSink(&quot;your regexp on table names&quot;, () =&gt; connectionString);  As with the SQL Server Source, the connection string is returned by a function to enable dynamic connection strings. The sink inserts data into SQL Server by creating a temporary table, which follows the table structure of the destination with an added operation metadata column. The data is inserted into the temporary table using Bulk Copy. This allows for fast binary insertion into the temporary table. After data has been inserted into the temporary table, a merge into statement is run that merges data into the destination table.
